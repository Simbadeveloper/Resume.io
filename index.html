      I strongly believe in all humans need access to health education in a reasonable and convenient time. 
      The entrepreneurship in me was found on the need to create a solution for my community which is marginalized. 
      Located at a remote area with people suffering from health problem issues i saw i need to do something.
      Being raised by a family where all my parents were medical practionare and a teacher,
      seeing the impact they had created in our community pushed me further. 
      Having worked for USAid,Community outreah,AMref just  to name  a few, 
      I saw the challenges faced by communities from adapting our solutions and 
      thus I saw the need to venture into health educating the community on the importance of their health.</p>
